<tr><td>

<p>
Project 2 is an open-ended project that must be done in a team of 3-5
people and must be (at least partially) deployed on Azure. For this
project you can use the same team from project 1, or you can form a
new team. I encourage you to form teams of 4 people: this will allow
us to grant you more time for your demos, and will provide you with
sufficient developer power to execute on an ambitious project.
</p>

<p>
Note that two key project deliverables are write-ups
(proposal/report). The proposal write-up alone is 10% of your final
mark! The proposal and the final report must clearly convey the
high-level ideas, be technically thorough, and must be
well-written. Quality technical writing takes time and care. Use
well-established methods to improve your writing: draft increasingly
detailed outlines, get feedback from your peers/TAs on early ideas and
drafts, compose descriptive infographics/diagrams, use the
spellchecker, etc. Proposal write-ups that are vague, incomplete, or
incoherent will receive a poor mark (you will also probably have to
redo your proposal, but with much less time).
</p>

<h4>Type of project</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
Your project must address a non-trivial problem related
to <b>distributed systems</b>. It must include a substantial software
effort in Go. Note that 'substantial' includes complexity and not just
code size. The most direct way to satisfy the project requirement is
to prototype a distributed system. Such a system can be built from
scratch, but the project can also be formulated as a non-trivial
extension to an existing system. The idea behind the system does not
need to be original, but the majority of the distributed logic in the
implemented system must be implemented by the project team.
</p>

<p>As a benchmark, your project must have about the same
complexity/difficulty as <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs416_2017w2/project1/index.html">project
1</a>.</p>

<p>
Project constraints (evolving):
</p><ul>

  <li>Go must be used for the core distributed logic in the
    system. However, other languages may also be used in the
    project. For example, you can build a distributed system in Go and
    have Android clients, implemented in Java, that connect to it and
    use it.
  </li>

  <li>The system must be able to support node churn: nodes that fail
    and leave the system, as well as nodes that join the system.</li>

  <li>The system cannot be embarrassingly parallel: there must be some
    distributed state and coordination between nodes in your
    system.</li>

  <li>At least some part of the system must be deployed on Azure.</li>

  <li>The system must be well tested.</li>

</ul>
<p></p>


<h4>Project ideas</h4>
<div class="hbar"></div>

<p>
Here are several project ideas. Treat these as inspiration; I strongly
encourage you to come up with your own project idea.
</p>

<p><b>Project idea: Build an anonymity network</b></p>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">Tor</a>
is an anonymity system built
on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing">onion
routing</a>. Tor allows clients to obfuscate their network
identity/location (IP address). The idea is simple, but supporting
multiple clients, defending against attacks, and providing good
performance to clients (e.g., responsive browsing) are non-trivial
requirements.
</p>

<img style="float:right; padding-left:2%; width:50%; padding-right:2%" src="./Project 2_files/tor.png">

<p>
One version of this project is to prototype a basic version of Tor,
deploying it on Azure, and demonstrating that you can use it to
browser the internet. A basic version might include:
</p><ul>
<li>Handling connecting/disconnecting guard/relay/exit nodes</li>
<li>Secure onion routing (intermediate hops do not observe payload)</li>
<li>Circuit setup/tear-down protocols</li>
<li>Periodic circuit refresh to avoid using a circuit for too long</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
Tor is just one type of anonymity system. If you are interested in
this space, there are a variety of other system designs that you can
adopt. Or, feel free to create a new one!
</p>

<img style="float:right; padding-left:2%; width:30%; padding-right:2%" src="./Project 2_files/p2p-ml.png">

<h4>Project idea: Build a peer-to-peer machine learning system</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
Machine learning is all the rage. There are many distributed
frameworks, but all of them assume a centralized learning process with
access to a central store of training data. Build a peer-to-peer
solution for learning a global model (of a variety of your choice)
that has as few centralized components as possible and where data is
spread across peers. Assume an adversarial context in which peers do
not want to reveal their data to others. For this project you may want
to recruit to your team someone who has taken CPSC 340 (and has done
well in it). You can also substantially expand the security/privacy
requirements of this project.
</p>


<h4>Project idea: Build a distributed web crawler/search engine</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<img style="float:right; padding-left:2%; width:40%; padding-right:2%" src="./Project 2_files/arch.png">

<p>
Web crawling is kind of a 90s topic. But, an efficient and scalable
version is a complex distributed system with many interesting
pieces. Last
year's <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs416_2016w2/assign5/index.html">assignment
5</a> describes an 'assignment' version of a web crawler that is a
good starting point. This version described a set of worker crawlers
that are spread over multiple data-centers, a web-graph that is
maintained in a distributed fashion, a distributed page rank
computation, and keyword search capability. You could extend this
version or consider building a different variant.
</p>


<p><b>Some other project ideas</b></p>

<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<ul>
<li>Build a distributed object system,
like <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=42182">Emerald</a>
but without a compiler.</li>

<li>Build a distributed shared memory system,
like <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp11/cse223b/papers/keleher94.pdf">Treadmarks</a></li>

<li>Build a distributed assertions mechanism that can be used for
runtime checking of distributed systems.</li>

<li>Implement a byzantine fault tolerance algorithm, an example
is <a href="http://www.pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf">PBFT</a></li>

</ul>

<br>
<h3>Proposal</h3>
<div class="hbar"></div>

<p>A project proposal is a paper that details the problem, your
proposed approach/solution to the problem, a realistic timeline for
your team's actions to create the solution, and
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT
analysis</a> for your team/project. </p>

<p>
You should aim for a proposal that is about 5 pages long. Shorter and
you're probably missing some detail; longer and it becomes too
detailed and too long to read. That said, there are <b>no</b> page
limits (lower bounds nor upper bounds) on your proposal.
</p>

<p>Here are three example proposals from the last time I taught this
course with an open-ended project:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs416_2017w2/project2/project_c9f7_i5l8_o0p4_p0j8_proposal.pdf">Heterogeneous Dynamic BSP programming in Go with a Pregel-inspired API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs416_2017w2/project2/project_m6r8_s8u8_v5v8_y6x8_proposal.pdf">Live Pod Migration in Kubernetes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs416_2017w2/project2/project_n6n8_u2c9_v0r5_x5m8_proposal.pdf">Distributed KeyÂ­Value Store Utilizing CRDT to Guarantee Eventual Consistency</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are two high-level ways in which I think about your proposal:
</p><ul>

<li><b>A proposal is a contract.</b> If you build the thing described
in the proposal then you get a perfect mark on the project. But,
writing good contracts is hard work. For example, a good contract must
be precise (it should be clear what you are and are not going to do).
</li>

<li><b>A proposal is your opportunity to convince me that you know
what you're getting yourself into.</b> I won't let you do a project if
I know that you do not stand a reasonable chance of succeeding at it
(this is a distributed system course, not an SE course :-) So, the
proposal should convince me that you know what you're doing -- that
you've thought about the key issues (you know what they are,
approximately how you're going to solve them), you know what resources
you will need/where you will get them
(technology/libraries/algorithms/data sources/hardware/etc), that you
thought about how to manage your time and how to manage the team roles
and responsibilities (who does what/when), and that it all adds up to
a realistic plan for a successful project.</li>

</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
You may also find the
following <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs538b_2016w1/proposals.html">proposal
advice</a> useful (from a grad course that I taught).
</p>


<h4>SWOT analysis:</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
Your proposal must include a SWOT analysis, which is a project
planning tool/exercise. The focus of the SWOT analysis should not be
on your idea, but on the various factors that will influence your
ability to execute successfully. This includes things like human
resources, time/scheduling constraints, etc.
</p>
 
<p>There are three key things you should focus on when you put this together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do this as a team: don't outsource this to one team member</li>

<li>Be honest: if you are worried about something, this is your chance
to get it out in writing</li>

<li>Be specific: you want each item in SWOT to be one concrete factor,
so articulate it as tightly as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some fairly generic <b>examples</b> (i.e., yours should be more specific):</p>

Internals (strengths/weakness):
<ul>

<li>s: all team members have worked with each other before, so are
familiar with each other's work style</li>

<li>s: entire team has extensive experience in programming in Go </li>

<li>s: project is based on an existing system that is well documented
and that two of the team members know inside and out</li>

<li>w: none of the team members know each other</li>

<li>w: team members have a variety of communication styles, some of
which will require non-trivial management</li>

<li>w: project will be difficult because none of the team members
understood Ivan's lecture on BitTorrent</li>
</ul>
 

<p>Externals (threats/opportunities) -- you'll probably have fewer of these than the internal ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>t: team decided to use Android phones, but this require finding a
library that supports Go-Dalvik VM cross-compilation, which may or may
not exist
</li>
 

<li>t: three of the four team members might have to leave town to compete
in the pan-American synchronized swimming competition; this would make
them lose two weeks of project work.
</li>
 
<li>o: one of the team members has a relative that works at Raspberry
Pi who agreed to send us 100 Pis to use for the 416 project</li>

<li>o: new version of Go comes out in two weeks and the word on the
street is that this version will include native support for
distributed objects, which will make our project 10x faster to
build</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your proposed project might evolve</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>The proposal is your best effort at scoping out the challenges that
you expect to come up against and some ideas/plan on how you will
resolve these. But, of course, system design and software engineering
is not that predictable.</p>

<p>It's difficult to describe how much you can deviate from the
proposal. So, UDP instead of TCP may not be a significant change for
some proposals, but could be a major change for others (e.g., if you
are investigating distributed congestion control adaptation in TCP and
now change to UDP, the difference is major!).
</p>
 
<p>Please discuss potential major changes with the TA assigned to your
group and/or with Ivan.</p>


<br>
<h3>Prototype implementation</h3>
<div class="hbar"></div>

<p>
There are no constraints on your distributed system design and
implementation outside of the ones listed at the top. If you have any
questions, please ask on Piazza.
</p>


<br>
<h3>Report</h3>
<div class="hbar"></div>

<p>
Your final report is a description of the problem you attempted to
solve, what you have built to solve the problem, why you built your
system the way you did, and how the system works/doesn't work. You
should aim for a final report that is no more than 10 pages long.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Extra credit</h3>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
This project is extensible with two kinds of extra credit:

</p><ul>

<li>
EC1 [2% of final mark]: Add support
for <a href="https://github.com/DistributedClocks/GoVector">GoVector</a>
and <a href="https://bestchai.bitbucket.io/shiviz/">ShiViz</a> to your
system. Generate comprehensible ShiViz diagrams that explain your
distributed system data/control flow and protocol design. These
diagrams/explanations must be in your final report and you must show a
live demo (loading logs into ShiViz and generating and explaining the
result). Store the logs for your diagrams in the report/demo in the
report repository.
</li>

<li>EC2 [2% of final mark]: Demonstrate the likely correctness of your
system by using
the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bestchai/dinv/">Dinv</a> dynamic
program analysis tool. You must generate at least 3 types of
invariants that illustrate 3 different kinds of correctness conditions
of your system. These must be listed and explained in the final
report. The logs that lead to the properties you describe must be part
of the report repository. You do <i>not</i> have to demo Dinv.
</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
